NEXUS | LOGIC ARCHITECT v2.5
OFFICIAL FEATURE MANIFEST & MARKETING POINTS

================================================================================
1. THE "VIRAL" SELLING POINTS (Why this beats paid apps)
================================================================================

★ "ADHD/OCD FOCUS MODE" (Neurodivergent Friendly)
   - The Killer Feature: Most circuit apps end up looking like spaghetti. 
   - One-Click Zen: Instantly snaps messy, curved wires into clean, 90-degree "Manhattan" circuit board lines.
   - Visual Calm: Reduces neon glows and slows down simulation speed to prevent sensory overload.

★ "HOMEWORK SOLVER" (The Truth Table Terminal)
   - What it does: One-click mathematical proof. It cycles every possible input combination (00, 01, 10, 11...) and generates a professional data table.
   - The Flex: Paid apps charge $50+ for this. NEXUS does it for free.
   - Visuals: Renders as a holographic sci-fi terminal or a clean engineering spreadsheet.

★ AI ARCHITECT (Powered by Google Gemini)
   - Text-to-Circuit: Type "Create a 4-bit binary counter" and watch the AI build it for you instantly.
   - Smart Explanation: AI analyzes YOUR circuit and explains how it works in plain English.
   - ENTERPRISE CONNECTION MANAGER: Professional "Bring Your Own Key" system with connection verification, strict security validation (Regex), status indicators, and secure local storage.

★ SCHEMATICS LIBRARY (New in v2.5)
   - Pre-Built Engineering Modules:
     - 4-Bit Binary Subtractor (Complex XOR Logic)
     - 4-Bit Shift Register (SISO Data Movement)
     - Full Adder (ALU Building Block)
     - Traffic Light Controller
     - SR Latch Memory

================================================================================
2. PREMIUM AESTHETICS (The "Royal" Design)
================================================================================

★ Dual-Engine Theme System
   - DARK MODE ("Obsidian & Royal Gold"): 
     - A deeply immersive, sci-fi interface. 
     - Glowing wires with CUSTOMIZABLE COLORS (Gold, Cyan, Purple, Green, Red, White).
     - Holographic glass panels and neon data flow.
   - LIGHT MODE ("Blueprint Engineering"):
     - High-contrast, clean ink-on-paper look.
     - Zero distractions, solid black lines, distinct node borders.
     - Perfect for printing or classroom projectors.

★ Tactile Interactions
   - Glassmorphism: Real-time background blurring on toolbars.
   - Smart Menu System: De-cluttered "Three Dots" menu for file operations.
   - Smooth Navigation: Middle-click to Pan, Scroll to Zoom (Infinite Canvas).
   - Context Menus: Right-click to Rotate or Delete components.
   - Draggable Toolbar: Mobile-friendly top bar that swipes left/right on small phones.
   - Floating Palette: Fixed-position color picker that never gets hidden behind toolbars.

================================================================================
3. ENGINEERING-GRADE COMPONENT LIBRARY
================================================================================

Unlike "toy" apps, NEXUS includes components needed for actual Computer Architecture:

[A] LOGIC GATES (The Basics)
    - AND, OR, NOT (Inverter)
    - NAND, NOR (Universal Gates)
    - XOR, XNOR (Parity/Arithmetic)

[B] SEQUENTIAL MEMORY (The Pro Stuff)
    - D Flip-Flop (Data Latch)
    - JK Flip-Flop (Toggle/Latch)
    - *Essential for building CPU registers and counters.*

[C] COMPLEX INTEGRATED CIRCUITS
    - MUX 2:1 (Multiplexer): Selects data streams.
    - HEX DISPLAY: Full 7-segment hexadecimal decoding (0-F).

[D] INPUTS & OUTPUTS
    - Clock Pulse (Auto-ticking signal)
    - Push Button (Momentary press interaction)
    - Toggle Switch (State hold)
    - LED Status Indicators

================================================================================
4. PROFESSIONAL USABILITY TOOLS
================================================================================

★ Color-Coded Logic Architecture
   - Components are visually categorized for instant recognition:
     - GREEN = Inputs (Sources)
     - RED = Outputs (Visualizers)
     - PURPLE = Memory (Flip-Flops)
     - BLUE = Integrated Circuits
     - ZINC/GOLD = Logic Gates

★ Project Management
   - Save System: Download projects as .JSON files.
   - Load System: Upload and resume work instantly.
   - Clear Canvas: One-click reset to start fresh (with safety confirmation).
   - Collapsible Sidebar: Slide the menu away for a full-screen "Focus Canvas".

★ Accessibility
   - Keyboard Shortcuts (Delete key).
   - "Operations Manual": A built-in help modal explaining controls.
   - Mobile Responsive: Works on tablets and phones via touch dragging.
   - Direct Mouse Zoom: Scroll wheel to zoom in/out naturally.

================================================================================
5. SIMULATION ENGINE SPECS
================================================================================

- Real-Time Tick Rate: 100ms (Optimized for visual clarity).
- Event-Driven Propagation: Wires light up instantly when logic states change.
- Safety Systems: Prevents "Truth Table" generation on memory circuits (which would cause infinite loops) with helpful user warnings.
